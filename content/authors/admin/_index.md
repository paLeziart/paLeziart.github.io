Postdoctoral fellow focusing on the design, implementation and improvement of state-of-the-art control architectures for legged robots. My research activities are motivated by all the challenges that remain to be tackled to control such complex mechatronic systems in a reliable way in real life situations. The advent of machine learning techniques in recent years has brought plenty of promising results, to the level of what has been achieved by more classical model-based approaches. I am convinced that performances can be pushed even further by combining both approaches to benefit from the best of both worlds.
